<h2>Emporor Diocletian</h2>

<p>
    
    Diocletian, Latin in full Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus,<br>
    original name Diocles, (born 245 CE, Salonae?, Dalmatia [now Solin, Croatia]—died 316,<br> 
    Salonae), Roman emperor (284–305 CE) who restored efficient government to the empire after the near anarchy of the 3rd century.<br> 
    His reorganization of the fiscal, administrative, and military machinery of the empire<br>
    laid the foundation for the Byzantine Empire in the East and temporarily shored up the decaying empire in the West.<br>
    His reign is also noted for the last great persecution of the Christians.<br>

<p>
    
    Diocletian’s biography has been obscured by legends, rhetoric,<br> 
    the dubiousness of documents, and the hostility of his adversaries.<br> 
    Little is known of his origins. His father was a scribe or the emancipated slave of a senator called Anullinus.<br> 
    Diocletian’s complete name, found in official inscriptions, is given as Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus.<br> 
    He received the name Diocles first, then the name Valerius, after the name of his daughter,<br> 
    Valeria, who married Galerius in 293. The gens name Aurelius did not appear until March 1,<br> 
    286—that is, until after his accession. Nothing is known of his wife, Prisca,<br> 
    other than what the contemporary Latin Christian writer Lactantius Firmianus says in his De mortibus persecutorum,<br> 
    which is of debatable veracity. Diocles, having adopted the name Diocletianus,<br> 
    entered history like so many of those emperors who emerged from the shadows through force of arms,<br> 
    brought to power by the army. What is known of his appearance is based on coin effigies and on sculptures.<br> 
    From these it appears that he was tall and thin, with a large forehead, a short,<br> 
    strong nose, a hard mouth, and a determined chin.<br>

    <h3>Coin Facts</h3>

    <p>
        
        Minting process, Producing coins was a complicated process. It was complicated on purpose in order to prevent fake coins from being produced and circulated.<br> 
        The production of coins required special equipment and a process which produced a distinct detailed relief image free of cavities (due to oxygen bubbles)<br> 
        and which made the coins gloss. It also required specific quantities of (precious) metal.<br> 
        Romans used an almost industrial process to produce coins which were quite detailed and cleaner than Greek coins.<br>
        The equipment to make coins included casts on which liquid metal was poured in order to produce blanks (coins with no images on them).<br> 
        Other equipment included two die usually made of bronze. The die had the negative of the relief image to be created.<br> 
        The lower die usually had the image of a deity. The upper die that of a symbol of Rome.<br> 
        A blank was warmed in an oven. It was then placed on the lower die.<br> 
        Then the upper die was put above it and struck with a heavy hammer.<br>
        Initially the minting of all coins was made in the city of Rome. Later during the Empire,<br> 
        the minting of bronze and of some silver coins could be made at other mints at other locations.<br> 
        It is worth noting that all gold coins were made by only one mint situated in the city of Rome throughout the Republic and in the first few centuries of the Empire.<br>
        
    <p>
        
        Coins initially featured deities. Later during the Empire they featured the heads of Emperor,<br> 
        noting that Caesar is the first to have started the trend of putting the head / bust of a living person on coins.<br> 
        Coins often had propaganda purposes.<br>

    <h3>Gladiotor</h3>

    <h3>Facts</h3>
    
    Who were the Roman gladiators
    Most Roman gladiators were de-facto slaves, and as such had no rights in Roman society
    and were scarcely considered people. For every epic story of a gladiator becoming a legend of the arena and winning fame and freedom, 
    thousands of others died anonymously on the sand.
    They led violent, dangerous lives and were subject to the whims of their superiors
    Some managed to overcome these circumstances and became celebrities, but they were a very small minority.
    Types of gladiators
    There were over two dozen different types of gladiators, distinguished from each other by the weapons they used, 
    the armor they wore, the fighting styles they employed, and the events at which they fought.
    Below you will find a list of the most recognizable ones:
    Murmillo, heavily armored gladiators that used a large, oblong shield and a sword called a gladius. 
    Their most distinctive trait was the full-cover helmet decorated with a fish-shaped crest.
    Thraxes, which wore similar armor to the Murmillo, but who used a smaller,
    rectangular shield and a curved thracian sword. Their helmet also covered the entire head, 
    but was decorated with a griffin instead of a fish.
    Retiarius, the famous gladiators wielding a large net and a trident. 
    They wore lighter armor and had no shield,
    and fought by attempting to trap their opponents under their net and stabbing at them with their three-pronged spear.
    Essedarius, which were mounted gladiators. There is little information on them beyond that they fought mounted on chariots.
    Hoplomachus, which translates to ‘armed fighter’ in greek, were gladiators who carried a throwing spear, 
    a short sword, a small, round shield, and who sported a plumed helmet.<br>

    <p> 

        what Animals did they use in the Colosseum and amphitheatres?
        There are many examples of animals listed to have been used, but in many cases its quite hard to find concrete evidence. 
        Therefore the easiest way to display in the information is to list all the purported animals that were used
        and where evidence is available we can also provide that too.<br> 

        -Lions<br>
        -Bears<br>
        -Tigers<br>
        -Bulls<br>
