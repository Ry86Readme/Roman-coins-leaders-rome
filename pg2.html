<h3>Emperor Caracalla</h3>

<p>

    When we think about Emperor Caracalla, it’s hard to think of anything but blood and violence.<br> 
    After all, he may have begun his reign with a massacre in York,<br>
    and then committed fratricide and ordered mass executions when he returned to Rome from Britannia.<br>
    The beginning of his reign was also punctuated by another act that has caused some debate among scholars over the years.<br>
    In A.D. 212, shortly after murdering his brother,<br>
    Caracalla created an edict named the Constitutio Antoniniana which was,<br>
    according to eminent historian, Michael Grant, “one of the outstanding features of the period,<br>
    although whether it seemed the same to contemporaries is uncertain.”<br>

<h3>Emporor Hadrian</h3>

<p>
    
    Born as Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer, Hadrian is considered one of the five good Roman emperors<br>
    (Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius).<br>
    When the talk turns to the Roman empire, we often tend to think of the various Roman emperors, their lavish lifestyle,<br>
    beautiful palaces, and immense power. But this is far from the truth,<br> 
    almost all of them had to struggle to protect or expand their rule.<br>
    Among the many famous and infamous emperors,<br> 
    Hadrian stands out as a highly capable ruler who had a liking for Greek culture.<br> 
    His birthplace is still a matter of debate, some claim he saw the light of the day in Italica near Santiponce (Spain).<br> 
    He is famous for ordering the construction of a wall―Hadrian’s Wall―about 73 miles long at the northernmost boundary<br> 
    (present-day Britain) of his empire. He was a poet, and as a student, he was fascinated with Greek culture.<br> 
    But there is more to him than just architecture.<br> 
    Historyplex has listed out some interesting facts that tell us who Hadrian was and how he become an emperor.<br>

<h3>Emperor Gratian</h3>

<h3>Facts</h3>

    <p>
    
        Gratian, Latin in full Flavius Gratianus Augustus,<br> 
        (born 359, Sirmium, Pannonia [now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia]—died August 25, 383,<br>
        Lugdunum, Lugdunensis [now Lyon, France]), Roman emperor from 367 to 383.<br> 
        During part of his reign he shared this office with his father, Valentinian I (reigned 364–375),<br> 
        and his uncle Valens (reigned 364–378). By proclaiming the eight-year-old Gratian as Augustus (coruler),<br> 
        his father sought to assure a peaceful succession to imperial power.<br> 
        The boy’s education was entrusted to the poet Ausonius, whom he appointed praetorian prefect.<br> 
        Upon the death of Valentinian I (November 17, 375), Gratian was appointed sole ruler of the West.<br> 
        Shortly thereafter he recognized as a colleague his four-year-old half brother, Valentinian,<br> 
        who had been proclaimed Emperor Valentinian II by the troops at Aquincum (near Budapest).<br> 
        Under Ausonius’s influence Gratian sought to make his rule mild and popular.<br> 
        He spent most of his reign in Gaul repelling the tribes that were invading from across the Rhine River.<br> 
        In 378 he arrived too late to take part in the disastrous battle with the Goths at Adrianople.<br> 
        As a replacement for Valens, who was killed in that conflict,<br> 
        Gratian appointed Theodosius emperor of the East in 379.<br>
