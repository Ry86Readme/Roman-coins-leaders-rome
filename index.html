<h2>Facts</h2>

    <h3>Gaius Julius Caesar</h3> 
    
    (Latin: [ˈɡaːiʊs ˈjuːliʊs ˈkae̯sar]; 12 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC)<br>
    was a Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.<br>
    In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years.<br>
    Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate,<br> 
    among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians<br> 
    in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, which greatly extended Roman territory.<br> 
    During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the Rhine river. 
    These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey,<br>
    who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded,<br>
    the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome.<br> 
    Leaving his command in Gaul would mean losing his immunity to criminal prosecution by his enemies; knowing this,<br> 
    Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army.<br>
    This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near unchallenged power and influence.<br>

<p>
    In the Roman era, only Rome itself was authorized to mint coins made from precious metals like silver and gold.<br>
    The image on the old Roman coins became drastically significant when Julius Caesar<br>
    (military general and political leader who played vital role in transforming the republic to an empire)<br>
    
    In the Roman era we have to be aware that there are two great historical periods, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.<br>
    We can focus on either of these two or mix them up.<br>
    If we want to focus on one period, choosing the value we want would be the most advisable option.<br>
    There are Roman coins made of several metals; like copper, gold – like the Aces and the Aurus ones,<br>
    or also in silver, like the famous denarius.<br>
    

<h3>EID MAR denarius The average weight was 3.47 grams </h3>

<h3>Facts</h3>

<p>
    One of the most famous coins of all time is the EID MAR denarius issued by Marcus Junius Brutus in 43/42 BC.<br>
    When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, he threw Rome into more than three years of civil war,<br>
    eliminating his opponents along the way. In 49 BC, many leading citizens, including some sixty Roman Senators,<br>
    had come to see Caesar as a power-grabber who wanted to make himself king.<br>
    This state of affairs was an unacceptable situation for men like Brutus,<br>
    who wished to retain their beloved Republic.<br>

<h3>Gold Aureus</h3>

<p>
   Coins hold a very special place among archaeological finds. They occur in large quantities over the whole area of Roman occupation<br>
   and provide information about the politics, economy and art of the province. Coins offer a unique opportunity for close dating<br>
   if it can be established how long after minting the coin was lost.<br> 
   Objects found with them can be dated and it is possible to establish the age of a stratified level in which one is found.<br>

<h3>Nero Aureus weight 7.27 grams</h3>

<p>
    In 64 A.D. Nero devalued the gold Aureus and silver Denarius by increasing the number of coins struck from one pound of metal.<br> 
    The new values were 45 Aurei to the pound and 96 Denarii to the pound.<br>

<p>
    <h3>Facts</h3>
    
    Nero was born near Rome on 15 December 37 AD and was known as a child as Domitius.<br>
    Through his mother Agrippina he was the only surviving direct male descendant of the emperor Augustus.<br>
    In 49 AD, Agrippina married her uncle, the emperor Claudius, and began to promote her own son's claim to the succession,<br> 
    at the expense of Claudius's own son, Britannicus. She persuaded Claudius to adopt Domitius - who now took the name Nero<br> 
    as his son and when it seemed as if Britannicus would be favoured, she had Claudius poisoned and Nero became emperor.<br>

<h3>Facts</h3>

<p>
    
    By the mid-third century this neat system of coinage was collapsing and the quality of metal was deteriorating.<br>
    Another major change occurred at this time when the radiate crown was introduced onto the portraits of the obverse of the coins.<br> 
    These “radiate” coins are very useful to the archaeologist as they were minted for a very short time between 260 and 300 A.D.<br>
    Only intermittently during the Roman period did Britain possess its own official mint.<br>
    For supplies of coinage the country had depended at first on the Republican mint in Rome,<br>
    where coins were issued by authority of the Senate, and later on the Imperial mints, most notably at Lyons,<br>
    Trier and Arles. Coins were struck in London for a short period in the fourth century.<br>

<h3>Honorius</h3>

<h3>Emperor Theodosius</h3>

<img src="Honorius-450x300.jpg">

<h3>Facts</h3>

<p>

    Flavius Honorius was born in the east in 384, the younger son of the emperor Theodosius I (379-395) and Aelia Flavia Flaccilla.<br> 
    In his youth he was named Most Noble Child (nobilissimus puer), and in 386 he held the consulate.<br> 
    He was summoned by his father to Rome when he was five, but in 391 he returned with him to Constantinople,<br>
    where in 393 he was proclaimed emperor. In 394, he was called to Milan, and in 395, when Theodosius died,<br>
    Honorius and his brother Arcadius jointly succeeded to the throne, with Arcadius ruling the east and Honorius the west.<br> 
    This year marked the beginning of the true de facto division of the empire into eastern and western halves,<br> 
    each under the rule of its own emperor even though, in theory, the empire remained a single entity.<br> 
    Both boys spent their reigns under the influence of powerful advisers. The first such power behind the throne in the west was the Vandal general Stilicho,<br> 
    both of whose daughters Honorius married -- Maria circa 398 and Thermantia in 408.<br>
